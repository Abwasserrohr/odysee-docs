# Following

Is there a creator whose content you really enjoy? You can follow them by clicking the Follow button on their channel or under their content.

Every time a creator you've followed uploads, it will appear in the **[Following](https://odysee.com/$/following)** category. This appears at the top of your homepage and on the sidebar.

Videos under Following will show in the order they were published, by default.
