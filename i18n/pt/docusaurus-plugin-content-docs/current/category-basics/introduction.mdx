# O que é Odysee?

Odysee is a blockchain-based media platform. We host all kinds of media such as images, articles, PDFs, audio files, etc., but we're best known for hosting videos. teste teste teste teste

Odysee seeks to recapture the spirit of the 2000s internet. Rather than favoring corporate content such as late night talk shows, network television, and TV news, Odysee is a place for everyone, including independent creators.

Referring to Odysee as "blockchain-based" isn't just sloganeering - all content on Odysee is hosted on the LBRY network, which Odysee then pulls from. For those interested in blockchain, this is really cool. For those who don't know a thing about blockchain, that's totally fine because Odysee requires zero blockchain knowledge to use.

We're glad to have you on board, and in this section, we'll be showing you the basics about Odysee and how to get started.
