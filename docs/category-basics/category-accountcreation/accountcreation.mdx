To create an account, you'll want to go to the sign up screen by clicking the <PrimaryOdyseeButton url="https://odysee.com/$/signup">Sign Up</PrimaryOdyseeButton> button. On the web version, this is at the top right corner.

On the sign up screen, you'll enter an email and a password. 

:::info Better safe than sorry!
We don't have password strength requirements, but we strongly recommend longer, complex passwords. We'll also check if your password has ever been leaked in the past, in which case you'll have to enter a new one.
