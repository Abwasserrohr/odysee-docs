# General Settings

Under **General**, there are three settings.

**Name** is the channel's URL. This is what will appear when you do something like leave a comment. The name can't be changed after channel creation, so choose wisely.

**Title** is what will appear on your channel page. It can be the same as the Name, or it can be completely different. It can be anything.

Lastly, your **Description** is to explain what your channel is to new viewers who come across it. As well, a lot of creators like to include things such as links to other social media accounts.

Your channel description doesn't affect your discoverability on Odysee, so use it to describe your channel in as many or as few words needed.
