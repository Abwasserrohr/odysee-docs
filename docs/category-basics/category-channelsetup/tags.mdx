The only setting under this tab is **Add Tags**.

Tags improve the discoverability of content, as well as tell potential viewers the kind of content to expect on your channel. We recommend simpler tabs relating to the genre of your content, e.g. Art, Gaming, Comedy, etc.

At this time, channels (and videos) can only have up to 5 tags.
