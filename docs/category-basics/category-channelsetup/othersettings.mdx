## Other Settings

Lastly, we have the **Other** tab.

There are a few settings here.

**Website** is where you can link a specific, primary site. Be it your own domain, Twitter account, or anything else of your choosing that you wish to highlight.

**Email** is exactly that - your email. Do note that if you enter your email, it will be public. If you want a public email for things like business inquiries, enter it here. If you'd rather not be easily contactable, leave this blank.

**Primary Language** is the primary language in your videos. This is important to enter so that we can recommend your channel to viewers who speak the same language as you.

**Secondary Language** may be useful to enter if your content is in multiple languages, or if you're bilingual and can communicate with viewers in multiple languages.

And, that's it! If you have everything set, you'll just hit the submit button at the bottom.

If you return to the **Channels** page, after your channel is finished confirming, you'll now see your new channel listed.
