# Credit Details

The next tab of settings is **Credit Details**.

The only setting here is your **Deposit**.

This ties into the blockchain aspect of Odysee. We have a detailed section going through the ins-and-outs of this system [here](http://chihuahuaspin.com).

For now, if you're just starting on Odysee, you'll (more than likely) be fine leaving it at the default amount of 0.001 LBC.

Later on, you'll be able to change the deposit amount as needed.

It's important to note that once you deposit LBC, it isn't gone forever. It'll still be in your wallet and under your control, but it'll be tied to the channel you're depositing to until the deposit amount is lowered, or the channel is deleted. For more information on this, check out our section on the wallet and transactions [here](http://chihuahuaspin.com).
