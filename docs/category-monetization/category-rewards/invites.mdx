# Invites

You can earn LBC just by inviting others to Odysee. At [odysee.com/$/invite](odysee.com/$/invite), you'll be given an invite link.

You can also access this page by clicking the avatar icon at the top right corner of the screen and selecting **Invites** in the drop down menu.

Share this link, and for every unique user that clicks on it, you'll be given a bit of LBC.

This is especially helpful for creators who are sharing their Odysee channel to their viewers. Instead of giving out the basic link for your channel, give the invite link.
