# Title, URL, Description

After your file is selected, the required field is **Title**. We recommend titles that accurately inform users of the contents, but are interesting and effective in enticing users to click.

Next is the file's **URL**. This is separate from the title. The title is what displays on the upload itself, this is simply what appears in the video's URL.

For example, our February feature roundup on the Odysee channel has the URL februaryroundup which appears in the URL, but the actual title of the post that shows to users is “New Year, New Us: Odysee Feature Roundup”.

After the URL, we ask for a **Description**. Spamming keywords and things in the description has no effect on search, so we recommend simply using this field to explain your video in as few or as many words as you need to.
