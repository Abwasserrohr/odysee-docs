# Additonal Options

Under this tab, you have a few options.

First is **Release Date**. At this time you can't set posts for future dates, but you can set them for past dates.

This is useful when uploading older posts. You can set them as the correct date, and they will show in the proper chronological order on your channel.

The next option is **Language**. This defaults to your selected language.

The third option is **License**. This is for specifying the copyright license.

This defaults to "None." If no license is selected, the file will be copyrighted by default. Other licenses are:

- **Public Domain** licenses allow reuse with no restrictions
- **Creative Commons** licenses allow reuse with attribution to the original creator
- You can also set the license simply as **Copyrighted**

Next is **Price**. This would be the amount viewers have to pay in order to view the content.

You can set this amount in LBC or USD. In either case, viewers would pay in LBC. If the price is set in LBC, that would be the amount of LBC paid. If the price is set in USD, viewers would pay the LBC equivalent.

## Credit Deposit

The last setting under Additional Options is **Deposit**.

This defaults to 0.1 LBC. If your file as the highest amount staked of any upload with the URL selected, it would appear first when searching for that URL.

For example, if two Odysee files have the URL "cat," the file with the higher LBC stake would appear first in the search results and would link from odysee.com/cat.

This all ties into the blockchain aspect of Odysee. We have a detailed section going through the ins-and-outs of this system [here](http://chihuahuaspin.com).

It's important to note that once you deposit LBC, it isn't gone forever. It'll still be in your wallet and under your control, but it'll be tied to the channel you're depositing to until the deposit amount is lowered, or the channel is deleted.
