# Body and Syntax

The **Body** section is where you'll enter the contents of your post.

Our text editor uses Markdown. For a detailed guide on Markdown, click [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

Here's a few basics:

- You can *italicize* text by placing one asterisk on both sides of any word or set of words.
    - Example (remove the spaces): * word *
- You can **bold** text by placing two asterisks on both sides of any word or set of words.
    - Example (remove the spaces): ** word **
- You can create headers using hashtags. The more hashtags, the bigger the text.
    - # Example Header 1
    - ## Example Header 2
    - ### Example Header 3

- To embed images, the syntax is this (without any spaces): ! [] (imagelink)
- To embed videos, you'll simply paste the full video link, including "https://".
