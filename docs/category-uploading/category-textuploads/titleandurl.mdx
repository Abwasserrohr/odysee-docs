# Title and URL

From this screen, the first field you'll be required to enter is **Title**. We recommend titles that accurately inform users of the contents, but are interesting and effective in enticing users to click.

Next is the **URL**. This is separate from the title. The title is what displays on the upload itself, this is simply what appears in the post's URL.

For example, our February feature roundup on the Odysee channel has the URL februaryroundup which appears in the URL, but the actual title of the post that shows to users is “New Year, New Us: Odysee Feature Roundup”.
