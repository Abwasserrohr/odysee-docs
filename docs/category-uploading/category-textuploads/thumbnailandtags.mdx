# Thumbnail and Tags

Following the description, you'll be asked to add a **Thumbnail**.

For thumbnails, we recommend 1280 x 720 pixels. You can select a file from your computer or paste an image link. 

Next, you'll be asked to add **Tags**.

Tags improve the discoverability of content. We recommend simpler tabs relating to the genre of your content, e.g. Art, Gaming, Comedy, etc.

**If your upload contains NSFW pornographic content, you must tag it with "Mature."**

At this time, each post can only have up to 5 tags.
