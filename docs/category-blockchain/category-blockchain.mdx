# Odysee's Blockchain

One of Odysee's major differentiators from other media platforms is that Odysee is built on a blockchain called LBRY.

In this section, we'll explore what exactly that means and how it affects Odysee. It's important to note, no one has to know a thing about blockchains in order to use and enjoy Odysee. It's similar to driving a car, you can drive one without understanding how the engine works.

This section will focus primarily on how Odysee interacts with the LBRY protocol. For a more detailed look at every aspect of the LBRY protocol, visit https://lbry.com/faq.
