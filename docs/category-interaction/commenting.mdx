# Commenting

Just watched a video you'd like to leave your thoughts on? Through Odysee's comment system, you can leave a comment up to 2000 words on that video.

As well, you can:

- Use emojis by the clicking the smiley icon under the comment box and selecting the *Emojis* tab.
- Use stickers by the clicking the smiley icon under the comment box and selecting the *Stickers* tab.
- You can attach a tip to comments by clicking either the LBC symbol or Dollar sign.

## Viewing Past Comments

You can view your entire content history in the settings menu.

First, click the Avatar icon at the top right corner of the screen and select **Settings** in the drop-down menu.

From here, scroll down to *Comments* and select **Manage**.
