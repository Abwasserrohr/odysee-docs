# Requirements & Limits

If it was up to us, we'd be syncing every channel that asked with no restrictions. Unfortunately, our YouTube sync resources are limited (especially as Odysee continues to grow) and we have to allocate them as best we can.

## Requirements:

- Your subscription count must be public on YouTube.
- Videos bigger than 2GB will be synced at lower quality (720p, 480p, ...)
- Private or unlisted videos will not be published. Copyrighted and age restricted videos may also be skipped.
- You must have at least 100 YouTube subscribers.

## Limits:

:::tip Notice:

Your channel limits are based on your subscriber count at the time of syncing. If your channel had 200 subscribers when enrolling but is now at 2000 subscribers, your channel would still have the 200 subscriber limits. To request a raise on these limits, email hello@odysee.com.
