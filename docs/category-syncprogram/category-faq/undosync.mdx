# Can I Undo My Sync?

Yes. There's no contract, hidden obligations, or anything else nefarious involved in the YouTube sync program.

Your content remains 100% yours, and you can opt-out at anytime. You can do this by deleting the channel entirely, or by requesting an end to your sync. This would keep your channel and all its current content, but prevent new content from syncing. You can request a sync cancellation by emailing hello@odysee.com.
