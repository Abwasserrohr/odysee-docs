# Thumbnail and Tags

Following the description, you'll be asked to add a **Thumbnail**.

For thumbnails, we recommend 1280 x 720 pixels. You can upload a file or paste an image link.

Next, you'll be asked to add **Tags**.

Tags improve the discoverability of content. We recommend simpler tabs relating to the genre of your content, e.g. Art, Gaming, Comedy, etc.

At this time, each livestream can only have up to 5 tags.
