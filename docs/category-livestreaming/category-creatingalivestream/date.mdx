# Stream Date

On Odysee Livestreams, we have two options for dates: **Anytime** and **Scheduled Time**.

When the date is set to **Scheduled Time**, your livestream will appear on your channel and in your followers' feeds in advance and will show the scheduled time. This lets your followers know in advance that you're planning to stream.

When the date is set to **Anytime**, your livestream will not appear until you have begun streaming.
